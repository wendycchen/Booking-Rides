# Booking-Rides

This project is a mini database containing booking rides system. It allows members and drivers to track down the rides they offer and request. They can also email their customers who book their ride. To sum it up, the members can access database functions based on their needs. It contains two parts, a login menu and an action menu, which is further divided up into six different sub-parts.

The above illustrates an action menu. Once a member is logged in after inputting their email and hidden-password, they automatically receive any new email updates. The member can decide whether or not to read the emails or to proceed with any of the following six menu options.
